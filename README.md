# üåê Culturally-Aware Urban Design Web App

**Google Summer of Code 2024 Project by Sonnet Xu**

## Overview

This project aims to empower communities through culturally-aware urban design and co-creation. Developed during Google Summer of Code 2024 in collaboration with the City of Boston, this open-source web application leverages generative AI to support urban planners in creating more inclusive and culturally sensitive designs.

## Features

- **RESTful API Endpoints:** Developed using Next.js to enable seamless client-server communication.
- **React-Based Frontend:** Integrated with the backend API, providing an intuitive interface for urban planners to interact with the data and AI models.
- **Generative AI Integration:** Utilizes diffusion models to generate urban designs, with the hopes of eventually being able to create designs tailored to the specific needs and histories of different communities.
- **Full-Stack Deployment:** The application is fully deployed using Amazon Web Services (AWS) tools.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Next.js, Node.js
- **AI Models:** Generative AI diffusion models (Stability)
- **Cloud Services:** AWS
- **Version Control:** GitHub
