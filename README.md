# üåê Culturally-Aware Urban Design Web App

**Google Summer of Code 2024 Project by Sonnet Xu**

## Overview

This code was developed as part of a Google Summer of Code project to create an urban design platform that empowers citizens to actively participate in the city planning process using generative AI. The platform allows users to generate images of city elements, such as bus stops, city centers, and more, by inputting prompts. Users can further customize the generated designs, either by editing them directly or by incorporating reference images to guide the generation process. All generated images are saved in a history log, enabling citizens to review, select their preferred designs, and share feedback directly with city planners.

## Features

- **RESTful API Endpoints:** Developed using Next.js to enable seamless client-server communication.
- **React-Based Frontend:** Integrated with the backend API, providing an intuitive interface for urban planners to interact with the data and AI models.
- **Generative AI Integration:** Utilizes diffusion models to generate urban designs, with the hopes of eventually being able to create designs tailored to the specific needs and histories of different communities.
- **Full-Stack Deployment:** The application is fully deployed using Amazon Web Services (AWS) tools.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend:** React, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Next.js, Node.js
- **AI Models:** Generative AI diffusion models (Stability)
- **Cloud Services:** AWS
- **Version Control:** GitHub
